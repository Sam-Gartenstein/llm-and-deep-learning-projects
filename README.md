# LLM & Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains hands-on projects focused on **fine-tuning and evaluating transformer-based language models**. The primary goal is to demonstrate practical skills in adapting pretrained LLMs to downstream tasks using modern deep learning frameworks.

Projects in this repository emphasize:
- Supervised fine-tuning of pretrained language models
- Task-specific data preparation and tokenization
- Training configuration and optimization
- Quantitative evaluation of model performance
